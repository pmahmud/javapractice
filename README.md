# JavaPractice
This repository have some java source codes that I am writing to prepare for
technical interviews.

## If you are using git-bash for windows, these custom bash commands may come
handy:

- create a bash file without the extension:
  name it : "jv"
  location:
```C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin```

- Compile the file first and then run it to see the output
```javac $1.java;java $1```
For example, if you have a file called HelloWorld.java, you would type in the
terminal:
```jv HelloWorld```

- Clean all the class files
  ```rm *.class```

The following list is little bit unorganized at the moment. I have done whatever
came up in my mind. Later I may want to come back to it and organize a bit so
that somebody else can find this repo useful.
